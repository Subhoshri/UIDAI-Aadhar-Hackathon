# UIDAI Aadhaar Hackathon

## Problem Statement
This project analyses Aadhaar enrollment, demographic updates, and biometric updates to identify societal patterns, operational stress points, and opportunities for governance improvement.

## Datasets Used
The analysis uses three UIDAI-provided datasets:
- Enrolment dataset (age-wise enrolment counts)
- Demographic update dataset (age-wise demographic updates)
- Biometric update dataset (age-wise biometric updates)

Due to size constraints, datasets are not included in this repository.

## Repository Structure
- 01_data_ingestion_and_cleaning.ipynb: Data concatenation, cleaning, validation
- 02_feature_engineering_and_eda.ipynb: Feature engineering, aggregation, exploratory analysis
